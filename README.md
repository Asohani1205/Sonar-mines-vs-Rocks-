# Sonar-mines-vs-Rocks(Data Exploration with Matplotlib)
Developing a machine learning model that can accurately classify sonar signals as either "mines" or "rocks." The dataset provided contains sonar readings that have been processed to extract various features, and each reading is labeled as either a mine or a rock.

Dataset Description:

The dataset consists of a collection of sonar readings taken from an underwater environment. Each sonar reading is represented as a set of numerical features that capture different characteristics of the object being detected.

The dataset contains the following columns:

#1 Feature_1: Numeric value representing a specific characteristic of the sonar reading.
#2 Feature_2: Numeric value representing another characteristic of the sonar reading.
...
#3 Feature_n: Numeric value representing the nth characteristic of the sonar reading.
Label: A binary label indicating whether the sonar reading corresponds to a "mine" or a "rock" (0 for rock, 1 for mine).
train a machine learning model using this dataset to accurately classify new sonar readings as either mines or rocks based on their extracted features.
